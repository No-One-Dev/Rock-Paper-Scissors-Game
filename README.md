# Hello there this is a Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a game to be played straight through the terminal.
I don't know if it works on other platforms other than windows
but give it a try. Have fun

# File structure
The main.exe file is the executable where the game can be run.
The main.cpp file is were all the code is sotred.
The README and LICENCE files are the files that tell you about the sofware.
And the .vscode is made to work on vscode but it also works if you have any other compiler
